Find Your Recipe
================

**Technologies Used**
---------------------

-   React
-   MaterialUI
-   Axios
-   HTML5
-   CSS3

**Overview**
------------

Knowing how hard it can be to decide what to eat on a weekday, I decided to develop a web app that would allow users to quickly find recipes even from a single word. The app consumes two REST APIs from RapidApi, one to to display recipe information and one to find youtube videos for visual instruction. Users can search using a variety of keywords.

**Functionality**
-----------------

Currently the application has been built to do the following:

-   Pull recipe data from the Tasty API
-   Pull weather data from the Youtube search and download API
-   Search and filter recipe data
-   Find similar recipes to currently open recipe
-   Fully responsive on all devices
